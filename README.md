## 11. CSV READER

### Status: **Implemented**

### `User Story`

- As a teacher, I want to specify a list of word pairs via a CSV file for my students to practice this week

- As a teacher, I want to specify a list of word pairs for my students to practice this week.

- As a student working with a textbook, I want to load pairs of words to practice from each chapter of the book.

### `Test Driven Development`

- When a teacher selects the "import word list" button from the main menu, the teacher will be prompted to find the CSV file that contains the pairs of words. The program will then generate a Sudoku board using the user inputted pair of words.
 
### `HOW TO TEST`

1. As a base case, start a new game as usual, and only words pertaining to fruits should be used in the making of the game
2. Download the provided CSV, called test.csv, from gitLab in the master repository
3. Run the app and click the "Import Word List" button
4. Navigate to where test.csv was downloaded to and click on it
5. A toast should appear announcing that the import was a success
6. Start a new game as normal
7. If the word "test" appears as a button or on the board, the import is a success
8. OPTIONAL FURTHER TESTING: repeat steps 2-7 above but with "test2.csv" to add colours to the game


### `Scenario 1`

### **Given**: The user is in the main menu of the application

![Screenshot_20190328-163859](/uploads/9ba0457a686723211785005c25e43f99/Screenshot_20190328-163859.png)

### `Scenario 2`

- Given: The user chose a desired csv file
- When: The user goes back to the main menu and then, and starts a new game
- Then: The application will generate a puzzle with the word list that the user chose 

## 12. VOCABULARY LISTS

### Status: **Implemented**

### `User Story`

- As a student, I want the Sudoku app to keep track of the vocabulary words that I am having difficulty recognizing so that they will be used more often in my practice puzzles.

### `Test Driven Development`

- When a user uses a hint while playing the game, a score incrementor will be applied to the word and the score will be stored on the device. If the user then generates a new game, the new board will choose words with higher scores to play with.


### `Scenario`

- Given: The user has solved multiple puzzles and would like to practice the words they have been having problems with 
- When: The user makes a wrong answer of a particular cell in the sudoku puzzle
- Then: The application will increase the "score" of the word and thus, increasing the chance of the word appearing in future puzzles

## 13. LISTENING COMPREHENSION

### Status: **Implemented**

### `User Story`

- As a student who wants to practice my understanding of spoken words in the language that I am learning, I want a listening comprehension mode. In this mode, numbers will appear in the prefilled cells and the corresponding word in the language that I am learning will be read out to me when I press the number.

### `Test Driven Development`

- When a user selects the "listening mode" from the main menu, the game will instead generate a board with numbers. If the user long presses a pre-filled number on the board, a Text-to-Speech function will be used and the language that the user knows will be spoken while the user tries to fill in the cells with words that they are trying to learn

### `Scenario 1`

- Given: that listening comprehension mode is enabled
- When: the user initiates a new puzzle
- Then: the user sees a standard Sudoku grid with some prefilled cells showing digits in the range 1...9 (1 and 9 inclusive) and all other cells empty

### `Scenario 2`

- Given: that the user is filling in the grid in listening comprehension mode, and that the grid includes a cell with the prefilled digit 4 and that word pair 4 is (green, vert)
- When: the user presses the prefilled cell having the digit 4
- Then: the user hears the word "vert" read out and pronounced in French.

### `Scenario 3`

- Given: that the user is filling in the grid in listening comprehension mode, and that the grid includes a cell with the prefilled digit 4 and that word pair 4 is (green, vert)
- When: the user selects a non-prefilled cell to enter the word "green"
- Then: the word "green" appears in the list of words that may be selected, but not in the fourth position

### `Scenario 4`

- Given: that the user is filling in the grid in listening comprehension mode,
- When: the users presses a cell and hears the word "vert"
- Then: the user does not see the word "vert" anywhere on the game grid

## 14. ERASE BUTTON

### Status: **Implemented**

### `User Story`

- As a user, I want to be able to erase a cell that I accidentally filled with the wrong word

### `Scenario 1`

### **Given**: The user is in the process of solving a puzzle and has selected a certain cell that was not pre-filled 

![Screenshot_20190328-164547__1_](/uploads/3b5cf201f52d2b529d70383b96d74921/Screenshot_20190328-164547__1_.png)

### **When**: The user clicks on the erase button in the top-left corner
### **Then**: The content of the cell gets erased and cell appears to be empty to the user

![Screenshot_20190328-164554](/uploads/068944aec041a66008db8487a70e11e6/Screenshot_20190328-164554.png)
